# The Grand Entrance

Choosing courage over caution, you approach the grand entrance of Ravenwood Manor. The large oak doors loom before you, adorned with intricate carvings of scenes depicting ancient myths and forgotten legends. With a deep breath, you insert the key and turn it, hearing the satisfying click of the lock disengaging.

As the doors creak open, a gust of cold air rushes past, carrying with it the faint scent of dust and decay. You step inside into a grand foyer, lit by a large chandelier that hangs precariously from the ceiling, its candles long since melted away.

The foyer is flanked by two grand staircases leading to the upper floors, and several doors lead off into shadowy rooms on the ground floor. The walls are lined with portraits of stern-looking individuals, presumably former residents of the manor, their eyes seeming to follow your every move.

Despite the intriguing allure of the manorâ€™s many mysteries, an unsettling feeling makes you reconsider venturing further alone at night. You decide it might be wiser to explore more during the day.
