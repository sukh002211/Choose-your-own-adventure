# Mystery at Ravenwood Manor

You arrive at the gates of Ravenwood Manor as the sun sets, casting long shadows across the grand yet foreboding estate. The manor, an inheritance from a distant relative you never knew, stands silent, its windows dark and unwelcoming. Your heart races as the gates creak open seemingly on their own, inviting you into a world of mystery and old secrets.

As you step onto the gravel path leading up to the front door, you hear the faint echo of footsteps on stoneâ€”yet turning around, you find no one behind you. The air grows colder as night approaches, and an uneasy feeling settles over you.

Inside your coat pocket, the key to the manor weighs heavily, both an opportunity and a burden. Tonight, you may uncover the truth behind your mysterious inheritance, but will you dare to venture inside?

Before you stretches the grand entrance to the manor, and to your right, a smaller, overgrown garden path that seems less traveled. You must make a choice:
